# Think Fast
A TFT simulator and APM stat check

## Description

This program is inspired by a prismatic augment from Riot Game's Teamfight Tactics. This tool is meant to help users practice their quick thinking and roll down reflexes in a no-stakes, stress-free environment so then when you decide to roll down, you'll be effectively using all your time and gold! (Imagine dying with more than 10+ gold)

### How it works

First, you'll land on the welcome page with our highest quality graphics where you'll be able to select what level you'd want to simulate rolling down on, how much gold you want to limit (or not limit ('inf' for infinite gold. yw.)) yourself to, and the two differing round timers that TFT offers. From there we move on to the team planning phase. Similarly to TFT's own built-in team builder, you'll be selecting your target team. Then, once you're all set and you've chosen your team, get yourself nice and ready and click that "START" button. You'll be immediately launched into the game and you can start practicing your roll down (don't forget you can use the 'd' key as a shortcut for refreshing the shop) (and don't press the 'buy xp' button... it does nothing lol). TIME'S UP! You're automatically moved onto the results page where you'll be shown your personal statistics. Here's a breakdown:
Actions: Any keystrokes or clicks you made during the rolldown
APM: Actions per minute
Hits: Units in your team that you bought
Misses: Units that you bought that is not in your team
Rolled Past: Units in your team that you did not buy
Hit %: Hit to Miss Ratio

Based on your performance, you'll be assigned a grade by my built-in system. For those of you familiar with MMR, the system and algorithm for calculating grades are similarly hidden from users.

Good luck and have fun!

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* None!

### Installing/Executing

* Users who are familiar with code libraries can just clone the repo and run it from their IDE.
* People who are just interested in playing the game can just download the 'Think Fast zip', extract the files, and run the application!

## Help

Good luck!
Just kidding, many users who download the ZIP will encounter issues where Windows Defender flags the program as a virus since the program itself is made by me, a smalltime developer just making fun projects for fun, therefore, it is not signed, and has no certificates attached (and maybe other reasons I'm unaware of) thus Winwdows will always play on the safe side to ensure your security and flag this as a potential threat. Now how to actually fix it: You have 2 options. Option 1 is to manually unflag it from your Windows Defender which you effectively saying "Hey, I trust this Eugene kid and his program." which is great. Enjoy! Or, if your parents ever taught you "stranger danger" and you don't trust this 'Eugene kid,' then the safest route is for you to follow the first point under the Installing/Executing header: to use an IDE, clone the repo, and run the code yourself. Those are your options, I hope this helped!

...

But wait! There might be a 3rd option. If you have read the 'Future Plans' section or you plan to, you'll see that I do want people to be able to access this and enjoy it because it's like my baby and I'm proud of it. So eventually, I'll be creating a more widely accessible version which you can always wait for. There you go! Secret option number 3.

## Future Plans

So a couple routes I want to take this project down the line. Unfortunately, I'm not sure of a way to bring this to a more easily-accessible plattform like hosting it on a website, so I may recode the program in another language or framework to make it more compatable with hosting on web services. Once I do this, I also want to start implementing accounts for users to save their results and consequently to be able to implement data trackers for user's to be able to see their progress and improvement over time. The other direction is to add another mode designed to help with flexible roll downs which would be far more complicated since it requires more imitations of Teamfight Tactics mechanics but would be a cool version 2.0.
